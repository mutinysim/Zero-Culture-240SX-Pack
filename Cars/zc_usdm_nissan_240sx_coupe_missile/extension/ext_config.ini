ALPHA_MASK = 0.0, 0.0  ; hole is everything with alpha below 0.1, everything with alpha above 0.2 is not a hole, in-between is a transition

; Patch can also estimate deepenings based on luminance and normal texture. Deepenings glow with a delay (but fully heated, glow more) and are a bit occluded:
LUMINOCITY_MASK = 0.01, 0.06  ; everything darker than 0.01 is a deepening

DISC_INTERNAL_RADIUS = 0.113  ; radius of an inside part of a brake disc

; Another feature is that patch would mask reflections with rim, stopping brake disc from reflecting sky if looked at a angle. By default it would use rim radius and 60% of wheel width (for the distance between brake disc and exterior part) from “tyres.ini”, could be changed if needed:
RIM_RADIUS = 0.1  ; inside radius of a rim
RIM_HEIGHT = 0.1   ; distance between surface of brake disc and vertical surface of a wheel rim
